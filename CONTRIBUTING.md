# Introduction

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) [![first-timers-only](https://img.shields.io/badge/first--timers--only-friendly-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

Thank you for your vested interest in this small project of mine. I hope it serves it's purpose of awakening interest in whoever is interacting with it, and I thank you for every small contribution you make, whether it be merely glancing at it, or actively contribute work to it. I hope it brings you to appreciating it more as much as I appreciate your time.

It is encouraged and kindly requested that you follow the guides and contribution guides referenced hereunder. Doing so allows you to automatically:

* indicate your intention to respect the developers, contributing members, and others who interact with the project to any capacity.
* Respect the time invested into this project by all its contributing members.
* Ensure you can reach the developers or other members in a timely and structured manner that helps to communicate your problem without fault.

## Contributions are welcome

We welcome contributions of many forms, including but not limited to:

* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports
* Feature requests

## Contributions we currently don't welcome

At this time, we discourage deploying this project as-is without ensuring that a user support system be implemented to cater for end-users should issues/questions arise.

For internal support on the USER EXPERIENCE or INTERACTING WITH THE FINAL PRODUCT or this project, it is CONDITIONALLY acceptable to submit a technical support question via the internal issue tracker, on the condition that:

* it is labelled as a 'tech support' issue
* is answered in-line with similar issues as handled by the team.

For support on DEVELOPING THE PROJECT through code, styling, documentation, testing, etc, it is highly recommended that the issue in question be researched online, as it is likely you will find your answer from there. Otherwise, the above rules apply for submitting technical support issues.

## Ground Rules for communication

### Responsibilities

* Where possible, ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted, primarily for Windows, Mac OS, and Arch Linux. If one or more platforms could not be supported, provide reasons on why this could not be supported.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep the complexity of simple issues to a minimum to avoid the possiblity of accumulating technical debt. It is therefore requested that major contributions are collaborated on with members of the tech team.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

### Your First Contribution

Help people who are new to our project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

Users are welcome to make contributions to any part of the project at any point; no idea is a bad idea. As an idea for where contributions would be especially welcome, the following issue types are useful for newcoming contributors:

* Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Ideal for those looking to get their feet wet without much investment.
* Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. Assistance in the sections would be equally welcome as beginner sections, but are more suited to those with an interest in long-term contribution to the project and are happy with establishing additional contact with the team.
* Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Helpful resources for first contributions

Let's cover some small guides on how to contribute to this project. As a quick refresher, you can follow to get started over at [makepullrequest.com](http://makeapullrequest.com/) and [firsttimeonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

As part of any contribution to the source code, we appreciate if the following procedures are followed:

* Fork the repo using your local Git tool.
* Implement the feature as-needed, ensuring it meets the practices and conventions followed by the team.
* Ensure the required documentation for the code is available for review.
* Ensure any and all necessary tests are available for the feature and that they all pass without fault.
* Publish a Pull Request or documentation.

### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch and attached via the issue it affects. Such patches will be automatically

As a rule of thumb, changes are those fixes which are either obvious to resolve or too small to warrant a branch of their own. Especially if they do not introduce any new functionality or require little creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes such as to meet un-linted files
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like rc files, .gitignore, build scripts, markdown files, servable assets, etc.
* Refactoring source files from one directory or package to another.

## How to report a bug

In most situations, a simple issue will suffice should it not exist. If it doesn't have an issue already, kindly create one accordingly. If it already has an issue associated, kindly leave a comment.

If the issue is a serious security concern, kindly do not disclose details through an issue and privately contact the team through one of the members. In general a security issue can be identified as _a means by which you can manipulate someone else's ability to interact with the project or it's outputs that allows you to gain an upper hand on the person through collection of private information their own property_. In other words, ask this:

* Does it allow me to get someone's undisclosed information?
* Does it go against the original workings of the application?

The definitions above aren't a one-size-fits-all scenario for defining a genuine security issue, so it's best that you take it to either contacting our team or reasearching the issue online.

### How to file a bug report

* go to the [issues page](https://github.com/Zach128/personal-website/issues).
* Click the create issue button.
* Select the bug report template.
* Fill in all sections as kindly requested.
* Submit it and await further feedback from the team.

## Submitting features

This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

Before making suggestions, keep in mind the following philosophy this project adopts:

* The project is here to facilitate a simple yet flexible-enough platform on which one can build their own personal CV/resume, either as an extension to their own works or to facilitate serving this information to whom they please.
* It is not meant to take on enterprise-grade solutions; this project is only managed by one person as a spare-time project. I do not plan on making any business ventures out of such a project.
* This project is meant to explore good practices in its many facets (such as this contribution document).

## Suggesting a feature

We very much welcome suggestions for new features/improvements. To do so:

* Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/Zach128/personal-website/issues).
* Click on the create issue button.
* Use the feature request template.
* Provide the requested information and be thorough to ensure we can develop the feature with little issue or misunderstanding. 

## Code review process

* Each feature, bugfix, or mergable change must be reviewed through a pull request. These changes cannot be made via direct publishing to a main branch.
* A pull request must be published through the project's [pull request page](https://github.com/Zach128/personal-website/pulls) by clicking the New pull request button.
* Ensure the appropriate PR template is selected as the basis for your pull request's content.
* Provide all the requested information and publish it.

Once published, the team will review the pull request. Below is a rough idea of what will be looked for in a pull request:

* Does the feature have tests included to ensure the functionality works? If not, are test cases at least included through a structured and understandable manner/spreadsheet?
* Does the pull request's description outline all the necessary information on what is added, what couldn't be added, notes on how to run it or expand further on it, etc?
* Do the enclosed changes meet the requirements of the feature to the length disclosed in the pull request's description?
* Do the enclosed changes meet the conventions, practices and standards enforced throughout the project without unwarranted compromise?

## Community

At this time, we currently only utilise Github for all communications for both issues, code review, code storage and version control, and project planning.

## Code Convention

Code convention has yet to be decided on. Eventually, one will be decided on and added to this section.

### Preferred style of code

### Commit message conventions

### Issue labelling convention
